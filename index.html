                    <h2>Biography</h2>
                    <p>Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor and producer. His career has
                        been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of
                        substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success later in his
                        career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in the
                        world,[2][3] and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid
                        actor.[2][3]

                        At the age of five, he made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in
                        1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less
                        than Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character in the biopic Chaplin, for which
                        he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a stint
                        at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally
                        McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He was fired from the show in the wake of drug
                        charges in 2000 and 2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained
                        his sobriety since 2003.

                        Initially, completion bond companies would not insure Downey, until Mel Gibson paid the
                        insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective.[4] He went on to star in the black
                        comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic
                        Thunder (2008); for the latter, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

                        Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark/Iron Man in ten films within the
                        Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008), and leading up to Avengers: Endgame
                        (2019). He has also played the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which
                        earned him his second Golden Globe, and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011).

                        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fahim-Nizamee/celebs-page/master/img/rdj3.jpg" alt="">
                        <p>Downey began building upon theater roles, including in the short-lived off-Broadway musical
                            American Passion at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1985, he was part
                            of
                            the new, younger cast hired for Saturday Night Live, but following a year of poor ratings
                            and
                            criticism of the new cast's comedic talents, he and most of the new crew were dropped and
                            replaced.[19] Rolling Stone magazine named Downey the worst SNL cast member in its entire
                            run,
                            stating that the "Downey Fail sums up everything that makes SNL great."[21] That same year,
                            Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played James Spader's character's sidekick
                            in
                            Tuff Turf and then a bully in John Hughes's Weird Science. He was considered for the role of
                            Duckie in John Hughes's film Pretty in Pink (1986),[22] but his first lead role was with
                            Molly
                            Ringwald in The Pick-up Artist (1987). Because of these and other coming-of-age films Downey
                            did
                            during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as a member of the Brat Pack.[19][23]

                            In 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out
                            of
                            his control, in the film version of the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less than Zero. His
                            performance,
                            described by Janet Maslin in The New York Times as "desperately moving",[24] was widely
                            praised,
                            though Downey has said that for him "the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future" since
                            his
                            drug habit resulted in his becoming an "exaggeration of the character" in real life.[25]
                            Zero
                            drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as Chances Are (1989) with
                            Cybill
                            Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal, Air America (1990) with Mel Gibson, and Soapdish (1991) with Sally
                            Field, Kevin Kline, and Whoopi Goldberg.[26][27][28]

                            In 1992, he starred as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin, a role for which he prepared extensively,
                            learning how to play the violin as well as tennis left-handed. He had a personal coach in
                            order
                            to help him imitate Chaplin's posture, and a way of carrying himself.[29] The role garnered
                            Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards 65th ceremony,
                            losing to
                            Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman.[30]

                            In 1993, he appeared in the films Heart and Souls with Alfre Woodard and Kyra Sedgwick and
                            Short
                            Cuts with Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore, along with a documentary that he wrote about
                            the
                            1992 presidential campaigns titled The Last Party (1993).[31][32][33] He starred in the 1994
                            films, Only You with Marisa Tomei, and Natural Born Killers with Woody Harrelson.[34][35] He
                            then subsequently appeared in Restoration (1995), Richard III (1995), Home for the Holidays
                            (1995), Two Girls and a Guy (1997),[36] as Special Agent John Royce in U.S. Marshals (1998),
                            and
                            in Black and White (1999)</p>
