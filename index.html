                        <h2>Biography</h2>
                        <p>Robert John Downey Jr. (born April 4, 1965)[1] is an American actor and producer. His career
                            has
                            been characterized by critical and popular success in his youth, followed by a period of
                            substance abuse and legal troubles, before a resurgence of commercial success later in his
                            career. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine among the 100 most influential people in
                            the
                            world,[2][3] and from 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid
                            actor.[2][3]

                            At the age of five, he made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in
                            1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and
                            Less
                            than Zero (1987). In 1992, Downey portrayed the title character in the biopic Chaplin, for
                            which
                            he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor and won a BAFTA Award. Following a
                            stint
                            at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series
                            Ally
                            McBeal, for which he won a Golden Globe Award. He was fired from the show in the wake of
                            drug
                            charges in 2000 and 2001. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has
                            maintained
                            his sobriety since 2003.

                            Initially, completion bond companies would not insure Downey, until Mel Gibson paid the
                            insurance bond for the 2003 film The Singing Detective.[4] He went on to star in the black
                            comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic
                            Thunder (2008); for the latter, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting
                            Actor.

                            Downey gained global recognition for starring as Tony Stark/Iron Man in ten films within the
                            Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008), and leading up to Avengers:
                            Endgame
                            (2019). He has also played the title character in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009),
                            which
                            earned him his second Golden Globe, and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows
                            (2011).

                            <p>Downey began building upon theater roles, including in the short-lived off-Broadway
                                musical
                                American Passion at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1985, he was
                                part
                                of
                                the new, younger cast hired for Saturday Night Live, but following a year of poor
                                ratings
                                and
                                criticism of the new cast's comedic talents, he and most of the new crew were dropped
                                and
                                replaced.[19] Rolling Stone magazine named Downey the worst SNL cast member in its
                                entire
                                run,
                                stating that the "Downey Fail sums up everything that makes SNL great."[21] That same
                                year,
                                Downey had a dramatic acting breakthrough when he played James Spader's character's
                                sidekick
                                in
                                Tuff Turf and then a bully in John Hughes's Weird Science. He was considered for the
                                role of
                                Duckie in John Hughes's film Pretty in Pink (1986),[22] but his first lead role was with
                                Molly
                                Ringwald in The Pick-up Artist (1987). Because of these and other coming-of-age films
                                Downey
                                did
                                during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as a member of the Brat Pack.[19][23]

                                In 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals
                                out
                                of
                                his control, in the film version of the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less than Zero. His
                                performance,
                                described by Janet Maslin in The New York Times as "desperately moving",[24] was widely
                                praised,
                                though Downey has said that for him "the role was like the ghost of Christmas Future"
                                since
                                his
                                drug habit resulted in his becoming an "exaggeration of the character" in real life.[25]
                                Zero
                                drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as Chances Are (1989) with
                                Cybill
                                Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal, Air America (1990) with Mel Gibson, and Soapdish (1991) with
                                Sally
                                Field, Kevin Kline, and Whoopi Goldberg.[26][27][28]

                                In 1992, he starred as Charlie Chaplin in Chaplin, a role for which he prepared
                                extensively,
                                learning how to play the violin as well as tennis left-handed. He had a personal coach
                                in
                                order
                                to help him imitate Chaplin's posture, and a way of carrying himself.[29] The role
                                garnered
                                Downey an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor at the Academy Awards 65th ceremony,
                                losing to
                                Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman.[30]

                                In 1993, he appeared in the films Heart and Souls with Alfre Woodard and Kyra Sedgwick
                                and
                                Short
                                Cuts with Matthew Modine and Julianne Moore, along with a documentary that he wrote
                                about
                                the
                                1992 presidential campaigns titled The Last Party (1993).[31][32][33] He starred in the
                                1994
                                films, Only You with Marisa Tomei, and Natural Born Killers with Woody
                                Harrelson.[34][35] He
                                then subsequently appeared in Restoration (1995), Richard III (1995), Home for the
                                Holidays
                                (1995), Two Girls and a Guy (1997),[36] as Special Agent John Royce in U.S. Marshals
                                (1998),
                                and
                                in Black and White (1999)</p>
